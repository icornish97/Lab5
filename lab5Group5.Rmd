## Lab 5



```{R}
library(tidyverse)
acc <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DS202-at-ISU/labs/master/data/fars2016/accident.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Part One 

While there is a fairly standard amount of crashes that occur based on the day of the week it appears to rise during the weekend, and peak on Saturday.

The frequency of crashes increases in the night time, as well as outside of the working day hours.
```{R}
acc %>% group_by(DAY_WEEK) %>% summarise(numberOfAccidents = n()) %>% ggplot(aes(DAY_WEEK, numberOfAccidents)) + labs(title="Number of Accidents (Week)", x="Day of Week", y="Number of Accidents") + geom_line()
acc %>% group_by(HOUR) %>% filter(HOUR != 99) %>% summarise(numberOfAccidents = n()) %>% ggplot(aes(HOUR, numberOfAccidents)) + labs(title="Number of Accidents (Week)", x="Hour", y="Number of Accidents") + geom_line()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
