## Lab 5



```{R}
library(tidyverse)
acc <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DS202-at-ISU/labs/master/data/fars2016/accident.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Part One 

While there is a fairly standard amount of crashes that occur based on the day of the week it appears to rise during the weekend, and peak on Saturday.
```{R}
acc %>% group_by(DAY_WEEK) %>% summarise(numberOfAccidents = n())
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
