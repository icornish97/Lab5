## Lab 5



```{R}
library(tidyverse)
acc <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DS202-at-ISU/labs/master/data/fars2016/accident.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Part One 

While there is a fairly standard amount of crashes that occur based on the day of the week it appears to rise during the weekend, and peak on Saturday.

The frequency of crashes increases as the day does on and peaks at 6'oclock.

There are 8720 accidents with at least 1 or more drunk drivers
```{R}
# Day of week accidents happen.
acc %>% group_by(DAY_WEEK) %>% summarise(numberOfAccidents = n()) %>% ggplot(aes(DAY_WEEK, numberOfAccidents)) + labs(title="Number of Accidents (Week)", x="Day of Week", y="Number of Accidents") + geom_line()

# Time of day accidents happen.
acc %>% group_by(HOUR) %>% filter(HOUR != 99) %>% summarise(numberOfAccidents = n()) %>% ggplot(aes(HOUR, numberOfAccidents)) + labs(title="Number of Accidents (Week)", x="Hour", y="Number of Accidents") + geom_line()

# Number of accidents caused by drunk driving.
acc %>% filter(DRUNK_DR > 0) %>% tally()
```
